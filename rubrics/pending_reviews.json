    "feedback": "Your submission is mostly correct, but there are a few areas that need to be corrected. \n\n1. In the marital status section, you mentioned that Fatima Al-Masri is single. However, according to the reference scenario, she is married to James Hart since 2015. Please correct this information.\n\n2. The section about serving in a foreign military is incorrect. The reference scenario clearly states that Fatima Al-Masri has not served in any foreign military. Please update this information.\n\n3. You have correctly mentioned that Fatima Al-Masri has no criminal record and plans to travel outside the U.S. next year, which is accurate according to the reference scenario.\n\n4. Your understanding of naturalization eligibility is evident as you have correctly identified that Fatima Al-Masri has been a green card holder since 2016, which makes her eligible to apply for naturalization.\n\nPlease revise your submission to correct the errors and resubmit. Keep up the good work!",
